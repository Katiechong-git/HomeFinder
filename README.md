Author: Katie Chong

Class Link: https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2020/

The project is deployed at https://obscure-everglades-06991.herokuapp.com/

Objective: An housing list application that let users explore a list of Craigslist postings. The app lets users see the listings in an orderly manner using pagination, enables filtering and sorting by different criteria and allows registered users to comment and share the postings.

Technologies: React, MongoDB, Express, Nodejs and passport js for authentication

The application has a home page where users can see all the housing posts, sign in and sign up pages and a postDetail page where users can see the full description and pictures of the posts, and be able to comment and share the current post on social media. 

Here's a preview of the home page with a list of housing postings
